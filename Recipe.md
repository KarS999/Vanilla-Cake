Step 1: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees
Step 2: Butter two 9-inch-round cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper; butter the parchment and dust the pans with flour
Step 3: Whisk 3 cups flour, the baking powder and salt in a bowl until combined.
Step 4: Beat 2 sticks butter and the sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Reduce the mixer speed to medium; beat in the eggs, one at a time, scraping down the bowl as needed.
Step 5:  Beat in the vanilla. (The mixture may look separated at this point.) 
Step 6:Beat in the flour mixture in 3 batches, alternating with the milk, beginning and ending with flour, until just smooth.
Step 7: Divide the batter between the prepared pans.
Step 8: Bake until the cakes are lightly golden on top and a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes.
Step 9: Transfer to racks and let cool 10 minutes, then run a knife around the edge of the pans and turn the cakes out onto the racks to cool completely. Remove the parchment. Trim the tops of the cakes with a long serrated knife to make them level, if desired.
Step 10: Enjoy
